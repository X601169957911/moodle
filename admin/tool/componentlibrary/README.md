## Moodle Component Library

The Moodle UI component Library is built with the aim to provide a single repository
of Moodle UI components to be used for new and existing Moodle pages.

A Moodle UI component is a self-contained UI element originating from one source file
that can be used in different locations in core code, for example a button.

This plugin generates the documentation of the Moodle User Interface components. It
is build using the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) docs and the [Hugo](gohugo.io)
static site builder.

## Build the Component Library pages

After installing Node.js you can build the Component Library pages by running:

Grunt componentlibrary

When completed the Component Library will be available from Site Administartion > Development > UI Component Library
